        An zero maintenance web application that persons/teams can install
        on their workstation or private network host that provides a fluid 
        and uncomplicated interface into a space within which to envision, 
        architect, elaborate upon, assemble, prioritise, sequence and assign
        the component tasks necessary to bring their software** idea(s) to 
        life.

        ** Although several of the primary features exclusively relate 
           to the processes involved in designing, implementating and 
           maintaining software applications - the posibility of a broader
           usage remains a very realizable posibility.
